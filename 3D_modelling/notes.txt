MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

3d room
	floor walls + ceiling
	absorption coeficient
	
only 2 point speakers
	full 20-20k hz from each point
	can be placed anywhere in 3D the space


what is the calculation?
	at any point in the room how different is the frequency response from the output?
	and/or any other audio "quality" calculations like RT60, C80, D50, DRR...
	which speaker setup gives the best sound? this could be somthing like wihch setup has the flatest distribution of sound qualities
optimisations?
	decreasing resolution of points that calculations are performed on
	decreasing resolution of rays or propogation waves from each speaker
	only checking output on a single 2D plane at a given height
	only checking output of a smaller 3D section 
	
visualising the output
	3D heat map which could be viewed as slices or some type of semi transparent web/bubble-like scructure


report 1
first report could be on what the map will look like and what factors will go into making it like an audibility index or somthing like that for each discrete point
find waves per reflections
complete differences formula

report 2
complete get times function


lecture 1 
absent

lecture 2
questions for tutor
ray traced audio vs point propogation or other audio simulation techniques
methods of judgment same as before but 3D or add in other room qualities DRR RT60 clarity

lecture 3
look at references managers like zotero
